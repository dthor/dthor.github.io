<p text-align:justify>I am an <a href="https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/549423">Aquatic Ecologist</a> with the National Park Service <a href="http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/units/ngpn/about.cfm/">Northern Great Plains Inventory & Monitoring Network (NGPN)</a>.</p>

<p text-align:justify>I has been working in freshwater ecology for 17 years. I earned a Ph.D. in Fisheries and Wildlife from Michigan State University, M.S. in Biology from Kansas State University, B.S. in Geography and B.A. in Environmental Studies from the University of Nebraska â€“ Lincoln.</p> 

<p text-align:justify>My post-doctoral fellowship work has incorporated principles of watershed ecology, landscape ecology, aquatic ecology, hydrology, and water quality in a systems approach to develop an index of watershed integrity for the conterminous US. The national Index of Watershed Integrity was developed as a first approximation as an applied index following a conceptual model of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.2978/full/">watershed integrity</a> highlighting the multiple human-related pressures humanity exerts on watersheds in the United States. </p>

<p text-align:justify>My past experience includes 5 years spent working on long term monitoring and research projects with 15 federally listed threatened or endangered fish species and with the rivers and streams they inhabit. I have spent many years working in aquatic bioassessment and community ecology, assessing relationships between community structure of fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages, aquatic ecosystems and multiple human-related pressures in the landscape.</p>

<p text-align:justify>I am very excited to join the NGPN team and help to further develop water quality and other aquatic components of the inventory and monitoring efforts for the NGPN.</p> 

<p text-align:justify>I am avid fisherman and enjoy exploring the outdoors via hiking, biking, camping, backpacking, and paddle sports.</p>
