<p text-align:justify>I recently started a new position with the Forest Service as a Regional Analyst, Natural Resource Specialist with the Renewable Resources Unit in the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/r9">Eastern Region, USDA's Forest Service</a> in June of 2019.</p>

<p text-align:justify>I'm an ecologist that has been working in freshwater ecology and terrestrial ecology for 21 years. I worked as an Aquatic Ecologist with National Parks Service Inventory & Monitoring Network, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/im/ngpn/index.htm">Northern Great Plains Network (NGPN)</a> and as a Post-doctoral fellow in c/o Environmental Protection Agency Western Ecological Division. I was involved in assessing current status and long-term natural resource trends and modeled watershed conditions. I recently joined the USDA's Forest Service, Eastern Region, Renewable Resources staff as a Regional Analyst and I am involved in landscape level analysis efforts involving forest ecosystem datasets. I work in various analysis approaches, techniques, and software programs for purposes including geospatial assessment, vegetation analysis, bioassessment, watershed condition, ecosystem dynamics, economics, and wildlife habitat. I play a supportive role in addressing a wide array of analysis needs in the forest planning process and I am excited to provide input and analysis for cross discipline large scale landscape resource management. I have a BS in Geography (GIS & Remote Sensing Focus) & BA in Environmental Studies from University of Nebraska-Lincoln, MS in Biology (Freshwater Ecology Focus) from Kansas State University, and PhD in Fisheries and Wildlife (Aquatic Landscape Ecology Focus) from Michigan State University. </p>

<p text-align:justify>My post-doctoral fellowship work has incorporated principles of watershed ecology, landscape ecology, aquatic ecology, hydrology, and water quality in a systems approach to develop an index of watershed integrity for the conterminous US <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.10.070">(Thornbrugh et al. 2018)</a>. The national Index of Watershed Integrity was developed as a first approximation as an applied index following a conceptual model of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.2978/full/">watershed integrity</a> highlighting the multiple anthropogenic pressures humanity exerts on watersheds in the United States. </p>

<p text-align:justify>My past experience also includes 5 years spent working on long term monitoring and research projects with 15 federally listed threatened or endangered fish species and with the rivers and streams they inhabit. I have spent many years working in aquatic bioassessment and community ecology, assessing relationships between community structure of fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages, aquatic ecosystems, terrestrial ecosystems and multiple human-related pressures in the landscape.</p>

<p text-align:justify>I am an avid fishermen and enjoy exploring the outdoors via running, hiking, biking, camping, backpacking, and paddle sports.</p>
