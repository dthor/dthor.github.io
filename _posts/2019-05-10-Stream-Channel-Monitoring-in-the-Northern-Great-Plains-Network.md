  The Northern Great Plains Inventory and Monitoring Network (NGPN) will monitor stream channel characteristics at nine national park units in Wyoming, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. NGPN has chosen to expedite protocol development by completing a Protocol Implementation Plan (PIP) to adopt an existing stream channel monitoring protocol. The key source protocol for this PIP is the Southeast Coast Inventory and Monitoring Network (SECN)'s wadeable stream habitat conditions protocol.
