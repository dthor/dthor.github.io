### RESEARCH
***


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iâ€™m an aquatic ecologist interested in landscape processes and the impacts of natural and human factors on freshwater ecosystems and how these factors shape community structure, function, and ecosystem serveries of freshwater systems. I focus on developing statistical and spatial models along with conservation strategies of my principal research organisms, freshwater fishes and macroinvertebrates to bridge gaps between ecological theory and large datasets to inform applied management of aquatic natural resources.

### RESEARCH GOALS
***
-	The application of aquatic landscape ecology to biodiversity conservation and management of natural resources.
-	Further refine the use of community assembly and trait-based ecology in an effort to conserve the biodiversity, function, and services of freshwater ecosystems.
-	Bridging gaps between community structure and ecological theory with large spatial and community datasets.
-	Application of modern statistical theory (Bayesian, multivariate and nonparametric) and modeling techniques for the use of ecology research and natural resource management.
-	Integration of GIS and remote sensing with aquatic landscape ecology.

### RESEARCH FOCUS  
***
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My research efforts focus on identifying and quantifying spatial patterns in the distribution in freshwater fish and macroinvertebrate communities, the natural landscape and anthropogenic processes that influence these patterns, how they change over time, and how to apply this knowledge to manage freshwater resources, preserve water quality and conserve biodiversity. Freshwater ecosystems are heterogeneous environments in which animals live that are ever changing in response to disturbances in the landscape, knowledge of how the disturbances influence aquatic communities is essential in order to predict and responsibly manage aquatic resources.
